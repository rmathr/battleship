<h1 align="center" id="title">Battleship</h1>

<p id="description">This project was part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The main goal of this project was to apply test-driven development (TDD) concepts to creating a Battleship game using JavaScript. In this game players first select where their ships will be placed on the gameboard choosing the position and orientation for all their ships. After the initial setup the game starts with the player and the computer alternating movements on each other gameboards. The first to sink all the opponent's ships wins the game. This project was made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. Webpack and jest were used to bundle and test the files respectively.</p>
